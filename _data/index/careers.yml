  desc:
    detail: Supported two target projects over the past three years, collaborating closely with medicinal chemists to ensure the optimal application of my work while proactively offering my expertise. Curated hundreds of experimental data based on expert-knowledge and conditions metadata. Led research in ADMET modeling, leveraging multi-task learning and novel deep learning architectures covering two thousands endpoints. Developed and implemented a novel approach for hit and lead prioritization. Managed virtual screening and analysis of commercial libraries, driving the acquisition of thousands of compound screening plates for testing against novel therapeutic targets.

  desc:
    detail: Conducted ultra-large virtual screening of commercial libraries using machine learning, docking and active learning. This work was coupled to predictive Graph Neural Network for data annotation and led to the analysis of poly-pharmacological protein network using ChEMBL, PubChem, and STITCH data.

    i18n: company_b
  desc:
    detail: Performed Structure-Based and Ligand-Based modeling of a membrane ABC-transporter protein in collaboration with an experimental team. My work involved homology modeling, ligand-protein and peptide-protein docking, as well as full-atoms peptide-protein molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, I optimized the hit peptide's amino acid sequence using a Genetic Algorithm, which was designed to minimize a machine-learning-based binding affinity function.
